# Demo Docker Workflow for [generator-ng2-webpack](https://github.com/cmelion/generator-ng2-webpack)

A Docker based workflow is a little different from the typical `npm install` followed by `npm start`  routine.
There is no local node_modules folder and all npm modules used are global modules.

Steps:
* Open a terminal
* `npm install -g docker-run` which adds support for [running docker from npm](https://github.com/mafintosh/docker-run)
* `npm run docker-start` from a terminal or use the npm tool window
* Once processing completes, open a browser window at http://localhost:8080
* Make some changes in ng2-webpack-demo-app/src/app/components/home/template.html
* Observe that your changes are reflected in the browser without having to refresh

You have access to the following sub generators:
* **yo ng2-webpack:service** (Creates a service)
* **yo ng2-webpack:pipe** (Creates a pipe)
* **yo ng2-webpack:component** (Creates a component)
* **yo ng2-webpack:directive** (Creates a directive)
* **yo ng2-webpack:interface** (Creates an interface)

You may prefer to use npm to run your sub-generators.
For a complete list of available commands and to add tab auto-completion, run the following commands in a terminal:

    $ npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    $ npm run <tab><tab>
    
which will produce the following output    
```

build                 docker-open-terminal  e2e-live              new-service           watch
ci                    docker-server         lint                  postinstall           webdriver-start
clean                 docker-start          new-component         server                webdriver-update
clean-install         docker-stop           new-directive         start                 
clean-start           docs                  new-interface         test                  
delayed-open          e2e                   new-pipe              test-watch    
 
```

This workflow serves as a starting point for building component based Angular 2.0 applications using Webpack. 

* Heavily commented webpack configuration with reasonable defaults.
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Testing environment using karma to run tests and jasmine as the framework.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

### Quick start


```bash

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# start the server
$ npm start
```

go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm run watch`

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`
